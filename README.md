OpenMORe is a collection of Python modules for Model-Order-Reduction, clustering
and classification.
Several techniques are implemented to accomplish the aforementioned purposes,
i.e.: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), K-means, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Moreover, a wide range
of useful functions for general machine-learning tasks are implemented as data
scaling, matrix sampling, clusters evaluation, (multivariate) outlier
identification and removal.
Requirements:
in order to use OpenMORe on your devices, the following requirements must be
satisfied:

Python version >= 3.6
Numpy must be installed
Scipy must be installed
Matplotlib must be installed

Installation:
if the libraries requirements are satisfied, go to the OpenMORe folder from your
terminal, and type: python setup.py install.
Usage:
you can run a quick test running one of the examples in the “examples” folder.
In the “data” folder, a collection of data (from a CFD simulation of a turbulent
reacting jet) is also contained to run the examples and test the code.
Example: python examples/clustering/LPCA_clustering.py
A detailed description of all the functions is available in the source code.
Several examples for different tasks (clustering, model order reduction,
dimensionality reduction, outlier removal, etc.) are available in the examples
folder, and they are also commented to describe the required inputs and setters.
Warning:
I wrote almost all the classes and functions from scratch, and I did not have
the time to test everything accurately. Given that, there may be bugs in some
functions. In case you spot one, please write to me so I can clean up the code.
